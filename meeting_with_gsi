	•	90% of our grade will be minimal viable product… so we can focus on 
	baseball or text to make sure we have a baseline that they can grade and then build on the other one.

	•	Histogram of neurons

	•	Visualizations of for gate

	•	What John Canny will be interested in —> casual inference

	•	Have 3^4 columns and comparing the results 
	(3 baseball pitches, with 4 different pitches)… neural network to explain things and statistics on 
	our data set and we can see what this maps and what the neural network does 

	•	weighted scored of LMST - NOT a good idea, weak claim.
